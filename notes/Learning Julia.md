Learning Julia

# Interesting Things

 • Integers are made unsigned by default when using hex primitives.
 • Very clean and intuitive syntax.
 • Represents computer abstractions cleanly.
 • Can easily write formulas by combinting literal and variable.
 • Literal zero() and one() functions are cool.
 • Infix notation is supported for operators.
 • Anonymous functions are supported using the -> operator.
 • Splicing arguments into functions.
 • Blocks, statement chains, all supported.
 • Interesting that conditionals only support bools, like Java.
 • Language prefers “look before you leap” (as opposed to Python).
 • Uses hoisting like JavaScript.
 • Scoping rules are dirty. Too many constructs, not intuitive.
 • Looping scoping is done really well though.
 • Tuples are types. I think.
 • Type unions are interesting. It’s like saying a value can be String or Int.
 • Type system is huge and at the core of what makes Julia interesting.
